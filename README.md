# Deep-Generative-Models

This repository contains the homeworks and final project work for the Deep-Generative-Models course. It includes assignments (HWs) as well as the project on *Aligning Consistency Models via Preference Optimization*.

## üß† Final Project: Aligning Consistency Models via Preference Optimization

The main project for the course is **‚ÄúAligning Consistency Models via Preference Optimization‚Äù**, which you can find here:

[Aligning Consistency Models via Preference Optimization](https://github.com/Theborna/Aligning-Consistency-Models-via-Preference-Optimization) ([GitHub][1])

### Project Overview

* The project introduces a framework for aligning *consistency models* (a class of deep generative models) with human preferences using an extended DPO (Direct Preference Optimization) approach. ([GitHub][1])
* It tackles challenges such as modifying DPO to work with models that are more deterministic (consistency models), preserving the consistency property, and dealing with intractable distributions. ([GitHub][1])
* The approach balances preference optimization with consistency preservation via a combined loss function. ([GitHub][1])
